				<img src="img/shingo.jpg" alt="Grave of Christ" class="img-responsive pull-right clearfix hidden-xs hidden-sm">
				<p><strong>May 2008 - June 2008 | Aomori, JAPAN</strong></p>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>My inaugural ethnographic fieldwork project took me to Shingo Mura in Aomori Prefecture. By all appearances your average Japanese village in the idyllic countryside, Shingo is home to the キリストの墓 (Grave of Christ), based on a <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-little-known-legend-of-jesus-in-japan-165354242/" target="_blank">local legend about the visitation and death of Jesus Christ</a> in the village. While previous journalistic accounts of the legend focused on exocitizing or debunking the validity of the legend (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/5326614.stm" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2011/12/25/life/behold-christs-grave-in-shingo-aomori-prefecture/#.VDbv8-e0bYA" target="_blank">here</a>, for example), I was interested in learning about how the legend shaped life in the village for residents.</p>
				<h3>Methods</h3>
				<p>To do so, I utilized an array of ethnographic methods:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Interviews with residents and village officials</li>
					<li>Site visits to the Grave of Christ and Legend of Christ Museum</li>
					<li>Participant-observation at the annual Christ Festival</li>
					<li>Archival research and textual analysis of past Japanese publications and media about the legend</li>
					<li>Hanging out with residents kind enough to endure the company of a clueless foreigner with too many questions</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Findings</h3>
				<p>Through this study, I learned about the process through which the stuff of legend becomes a part of local culture, creating new traditions, a sense of communitas, opportunities for tourism, and an entertaining sense of mystique.</p>

				<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cutlery"></span> Genetically Modified Food in Japan</h2>
				<img src="img/food.jpg" alt="A Japanese supermarket" class="img-responsive pull-right hidden-xs hidden-sm">
				<p><strong>September 2008 - July 2009 | Tokyo, JAPAN</strong></p>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Since working as an undergraduate in the <a href="http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/molecularecology/bop.html" target="_blank">Biotechnology Outreach Program at the University of Hawai'i</a> with Dr. Ania Wieczorek, I have been intensely interested in the intersection between science, technology, and society. In this ethnographic research project, I dedicated almost a year to studying Japanese consumer and activist experiences of genetically modified (GM) food in and around Tokyo.</p>
				<h3>Methods</h3>
				<p>I utilized the following ethnographic methods:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Interviews with consumers, activists, scientists, industry representatives, and government officials</li>
					<li>Focus group session with activists</li>
					<li>Mailed surveys to consumers</li>
					<li>Participant-observation at supermarkets, activist events, and government-sponsored public discussions</li>
					<li>Archival research and textual analysis of legal documents, popular and scientific publications, and media related to genetically modified crops in Japan</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Findings</h3>
				<p>I learned while no GM crops are grown domestically, and despite ubiquitous consumer wariness toward such crops, Japan presently imports the largest per capita amount of GM food and feed in the world. This significantly structures everyday food consumption in Japan because consumers almost never consciously purchase and consume GM food (despite the campaigns of activists) due in part to the discourses of absence and domestic agricultural purity they are being fed by safety evaluations, labeling laws, and government marketing.</p>
				<p>The results of this study have been published in <a href="http://soar.wichita.edu/handle/10057/3897" target="_blank"><em>Lambda Alpha Journal</em></a> and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666310006987" target="_blank"><em>Appetite</em></a>, and were presented in papers at 4 national conferences by the American Anthropological Association; Association for the Study of Food and Society; Agriculture, Food, and Human Values Society; and Society for the Anthropology of Food and Nutrition.</p>
				<p>For my research, I was awarded the 2010 (National) William White Prize by the Association for the Study of Food and Society.</p>

				<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-leaf"></span> Genetically Modified Papaya in Hawai'i</h2>
				<p><img src="img/papaya.jpg" alt="Papaya" class="img-responsive pull-right hidden-xs hidden-sm"></p>
				<p><strong>June 2011 - August 2011, June 2012 - August 2012 | Honolulu, HI</strong></p>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Concerned with the growing public debate about the place of genetically modified (GM) food in Hawai'i - a hotspot, due to its climate, for experiments and plantings of GM crops - I set out to analyze local consumer, farmer, and activist experiences of GM papaya.</p>
				<h3>Methods</h3>
				<p>I utilized the following ethnographic methods:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Interviews with consumers, scientists, government officials, farmers, and actvists</li>
					<li>Site visits to fields with GM crops</li>
					<li>Participant-observation at an orientation session for new growers of GM papaya at the University of Hawai'i</li>
					<li>Archival research and textual analysis of scientific and activist publications, legal documents, and historical documents about papaya in Hawai'i</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Findings</h3>
				<p>In a battle of narratives between activists, farmers, and scientists, GM papaya becomes either valorated as the savior of or demonized as the destroyer of the local papaya industry. However, either narrative obscures the complexity of growing papaya in Hawai'i since the epidemic of the Papaya Ringspot Virus.</p>
				<p>The results of this study will be published in a forthcoming book chapter of <em>Diet for a Small Island: Visioning Food Democracy in Hawaii</em>, and were presented in a paper at a national conference by the American Anthropological Association.</p>

				<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span> Genetically Modified Flowers in Japan & Australia</h2>
				<img src="img/applause.jpg" alt="Suntory APPLAUSE Blue Rose" class="img-responsive pull-right hidden-xs hidden-sm">
				<p><strong>June 2011 - August 2011, June 2012 - August 2012 | Kyoto, Osaka, and Tokyo, JAPAN & Melbourne, AUSTRALIA</strong></p>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>While genetically modified (GM) crops are in general ubiquitously rejected by consumers (as evidenced by my previous study of GM food), GM blue flowers (e.g., roses, carnationas, and lilies) are not only allowed to grow in Japan, but also enjoy the favor (or at least, apathy) of Japanese consumers. In this project, I sought to understand the exceptional acceptance by Japanese consumers of such flowers and the history of scientific collaboration between Japanese and Australian scientists in the development of GM blue flowers.</p>
				<h3>Methods</h3>
				<p>I utilized the following ethnographic research methods:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Interviews with consumers and scientists in Japan and Australia</li>
					<li>Site visits to laboraties researching GM blue flowers in Japan and Australia</li>
					<li>Participant-observation with artists developing and growing GM blue flowers</li>
					<li>Archival research and textual analysis of scientific and popular publications and media about GM blue flowers in Japanese</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Findings</h3>
				<p>Through this study, I learned about the significant role of aesthetics, history, literature, and marketing in consumer acceptance of new technologies.</p>
				<p>The results of this study were presented in 2 national conferences by the Japanese Studies Association and American Anthropological Association, and 2 invited lectures at the metaPhorest seminar at Waseda University (Tokyo, Japan) and Japanese Studies Centre seminar at Monash University (Melbourne, Australia).</p>
				<p>I am grateful to the Harvard University Reischauer Institute for funding this project. I am also indebted to the <a href="http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/jsc/" target="_blank">Japanese Studies Centre at Monash University</a> for hosting me as a Visiting Scholar in 2012.</p>
